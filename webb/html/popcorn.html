          <p>Also sometimes referred to as “snowflake popcorn”, butterfly is well known for its use in theater-style and home-popped popcorn products, usually offered-up with nothing more than a little salt and perhaps some melted butter. Its relatively delicate shape means butterfly popcorn is best consumed fresh-popped for maximum crunch and freshness.</p>

            <p>is perfect for confection-coated applications such as <a href="https://www.popcornopolis.com/shop-our-flavor/caramel-corn.html">Popcornopolis Caramel Corn. </a>Its sturdy baseball shape (without those fragile butterfly wings) withstands the processes of candy-coating, and because of its exceptional surface area, accepts other flavors (like cheddar cheese!) very well too. The resulting products are less prone to crushing, and once coated, will  tend to stay fresh and crispy much longer than their uncoated butterfly popcorn counterparts.

            <p>This yellow popcorn is dainty. If you love the tiny pieces of popcorn at the bottom of the bowl, you’ll love ladyfinger. The small size makes this type good for topping soups or baked goods.
